## Introduction
This project is a simple PHP-based template router, meant to support my hobby projects.  

## Disclaimer
While I take great care to produce code that is free of excess dependencies and short-sighted assumptions, I feel I should warn you
that this code is *not* primarily meant for public consumption.  In other words, please understand that if you want to use this code
in your own work you're free to do so under the provided license, but I'm not promising that the API will be stable or that the code 
will necessarily meet your needs out of the box.

So please, feel free to fork this code and adapt it to your own needs - or even better, offer comments on how I could improve the 
general-purpose nature of the code.  But also accept that at the end of the day, this really is just a starting place for your own work.
